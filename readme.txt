Debug Bar Localization adds a new panel to the Debug Bar which displays information on the locale for your install and the language files loaded.

== Description ==

Debug Bar Localization adds a new panel to the Debug Bar which displays information on the locale for your install and the language files loaded.

Additionally it will show you:

* The installed languages.
* Which text-domains were called from translation functions while no `load_..._textdomain()` call was found for that text-domain.
* For which text-domains `load_..._textdomain()` was called more than once.
* Which files WP tried to load to obtain a translation and whether this was successful.
* If successful: how many translated strings were found and when the translation was last updated.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can it be used on live site ? =
This plugin is only meant to be used for development purposes, but shouldn't cause any issues if run on a production site.

= What is internationalization ? =
> Internationalization is the process of developing your plugin/theme so that it can easily be translated into other languages.

Ref: [Plugin Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/internationalization/) / [Theme Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/internationalization/)

= What is localization ? =
> Localization describes the subsequent process of translating an internationalized plugin/theme.

Ref: [Plugin Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/internationalization/localization/) / [Theme Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/localization/)

= How do I internationalize my theme/plugin ? =
For plugins, see the [Plugin Handbook on Internationalization](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/internationalization/how-to-internationalize-your-plugin/).

For themes, see the [Theme Handbook on Internationalization](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/internationalization/).

= How do I localize my theme / plugin ? =
For plugins, see the [Plugin Handbook on Localization](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/internationalization/localization/).

For themes, see the [Theme Handbook on Localization](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/localization/).

= Why is my `load_..._textdomain()` call not listed ? =

There are several potential reasons for this:

1. You might not be loading the translations correctly. See the above referenced handbook pages for more information.
2. You might be loading your translations selectively (lean loading), only on the pages they are needed. If so, make sure you are viewing such a page to see your translation listed.
3. You might be loading your translations too early or too late. Translations are best loaded on the `(admin_)init` hook. For more information see [this article](http://geertdedeckere.be/article/loading-wordpress-language-files-the-right-way).

In particular take note of the following:
If your textdomain is loaded before this plugin is loaded, _i.e. if you load your textdomain on the PHP file load from a must-use plugin_, _or_ if your textdomain is loaded very late, _i.e. after the admin bar has loaded_, this plugin can not pick up on the `load_..._textdomain()` call.


= Why won't the plugin activate ? =
Have you read what it says in the beautifully red bar at the top of your plugins page ? As it says there, the Debug Bar plugin needs to be active for this plugin to work. If the Debug Bar plugin is not active, this plugin will automatically de-activate itself.


== Changelog ==

= 1.1 (2016-04-29 ) =
* [Enhancement] Don't show warning about duplicate load calls on plugins page as that's caused by core, not by a plugin and the warning could be misleading.
* [Enhancement] Make loading of 'our own' text-domain compatible with use of this plugin in the `must-use` plugins directory.
* [Enhancement] Improve categorization of the loaded text-domains. This mainly applies to text-domains for which the mo_file paths are being filtered.
* [Enhancement] Added a section showing potentially unnecessary/inefficient `load_textdomain` calls.

* [Bugfix] The plugin loading order functions were inadvertently checking the wrong value and - in single site - install, adding an invalid value to the active plugins list causing incorrect 'plugin deactivated as file not found' notices.

* [Compatibility] Fix WP 4.5 compatibility - the check whether a text-domain `load` call was made (ab)used a bug in the `is_textdomain_loaded()` function. [This bug](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21319) was fixed in WP 4.5. Fixed by creating a work-around to still be able to provide this information.
* [Compatibility] Prevent PHP error notices in WP < 4.0.
* General housekeeping
